      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Ivan Pavlov. I live in Russia Saint-Petersburg but originally I am from Vologda which is a town in North-West Russia. <br>
        I am ready to relocate to Central Europe and Canada.
      </p>
      <p>I had graduated Vologda State Dairy Farming Academy named after N.V. Vereshchagin as Quality manager in food industry.</p>
      <p>
        My job career began as a quality manager in a bearing factory.
        After several months of work, I understood that these responsibilities and salaries are not what I want to have in my profession.
      </p>
      <p>
        During service in Russian Army, I was thinking about my skills, possible profession and decided to become a Sales Manager of industrial equipment and strive to be a marketing manager.
        <br>Since 2012, I have been working as Marketing and Sales Manager of industrial equipment and raw materials.
      </p>
      <p>My hobbies are riding bicycle and photography. I prefer an active rest.</p>
